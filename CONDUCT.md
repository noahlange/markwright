# Code of Reasonable Conduct
This document provides community guidelines for a safe, respectful, productive,
and collaborative place for any person who is willing to contribute to this
development community. It applies to all "collaborative spaces", defined as
community communications channels (such as mailing lists, submitted patches,
commit comments, &c.).

Contributors shall refrain from making disparaging remarks related to others'
level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation,
ability or disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age,
religion or nationality. Behavior that can be reasonably considered to
constitute harassment with respect to these characteristics will not be
tolerated.

Furthermore, contributors shall be tolerant of differing or opposing views and
assume best the intentions of others.
